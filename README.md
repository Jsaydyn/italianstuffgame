This game is very similar to bingo. A random letter is generated, to which players fill on their cards if it matches.

Instructions:
1. All players pick a colour at the beginning of the game: red, green yellow or blue.
2. Generate a random letter on the game board.
3. If a letter is in the region's name, capital city or a dish from the region, place a letter in all places which it is present. For example, if a player gets the letter 'e', they can fill out the second and fourth boxes in the region name 'Veneto', as well as the second and fourth boxes in the capital city 'Venezia'.
4. Once a person writes out the region's name, as well ONE of the other boxes, they must identify the region on the map, which is numbered.
5. The person then selects their colour on the number of the region, to the right of the map, claiming that region. No other player can then fill out that region on their cards.
6. The first person to claim two regions wins the game.
